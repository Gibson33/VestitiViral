VESTITI VIRAL: Sneakers Concept Store

Welcome to VESTITI VIRAL: Sneakers, a fictional concept store designed to showcase a modern, responsive sneaker collection page built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.

This site includes a structured sneaker layout with styling enhancements for responsiveness, visual polish, and a user-friendly contact form. All sneaker images are AI-generated to avoid copyright infringement.

Features
Responsive Layout
The page adjusts gracefully across various screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system and media queries.

Sneaker Display
Sneakers are presented in a 3-row grid (up to 4 per row) with product names, prices, and a "Buy" button.

Hover Effects
Images gently enlarge on hover, using Bootstrap shadow utilities and CSS transforms for a polished effect.

Typography and Styling
Clean fonts are used across headings, body content, and form elements for clarity and visual hierarchy:

Arial Narrow for form and text sections

Large, prominent headings using responsive font sizing

Footer Contact Form
Includes a logo, a responsive grid, and a Bootstrap-styled form allowing users to submit their contact details and messages.

Technologies Used
HTML5 — Semantic layout for structure

CSS3 — Custom styling and transitions

Bootstrap 5 — Grid system, spacing utilities, button styles, and form components

Notes
All product images are placeholder graphics and not associated with any real brand.

The site is a frontend-only demo — the "Buy" buttons are non-functional.

The contact form does not have backend submission handling; it is designed for layout and visual demonstration.
